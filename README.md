A high-performance, real-time cryptocurrency mining dashboard built with SolidJS. This project demonstrates the power of Solid's fine-grained reactivity for data-intensive applications. It combines live cryptocurrency price data from the CoinGecko API with a sophisticated mock mining rig API to simulate a production-ready monitoring system.

The primary goal is to serve as a high-quality boilerplate and learning resource for building complex, interactive dashboards with SolidJS, TypeScript, and modern data-fetching practices using TanStack Query.

## Features

*   **âš¡ Real-Time Dashboard:** A central overview with live-updating metric cards for hashrate, power consumption, efficiency, and daily profit.
*   **ðŸ“Š Interactive Charts:** Smooth, real-time Chart.js visualizations for hashrate history, built for performance by updating the chart instance directly.
*   **ðŸ’» Rig Management:** A detailed table of all mining rigs with live status updates. Includes interactive controls to start/stop rigs, demonstrating optimistic UI updates with TanStack Query mutations.
*   **ðŸ“ˆ Live Crypto Market:** An interactive and data-rich cryptocurrency market page featuring searching, sorting, infinite scrolling, and 7-day sparkline trend charts.
*   **ðŸ”— Hybrid Data:** Seamlessly integrates real-world crypto prices to calculate realistic, dynamic profitability for the mock mining operation.
*   **ðŸš€ Modern Tech Stack:** Built with Vite, TypeScript, and styled with Tailwind CSS for a fast, type-safe, and beautiful user experience.
*   **ðŸ“± Responsive Design:** The entire dashboard is designed to be usable on both desktop and mobile devices for on-the-go monitoring.

## The Future of This Repository

This project has a solid foundation, but there is a clear path forward to evolve it from a sophisticated demo into a full-featured, production-grade application.

### What Will Be Done (Roadmap)

This is the planned work for the near future.

*   **Phase 1: Core Functionality (âœ… Complete)**
    *   Dashboard Overview
    *   Mining Rigs Management Page
    *   Crypto Prices Market Page

*   **Phase 2: Completing UI & Enhancing UX**
    *   **Settings Page:** Implement the settings page to allow users to change the currency (`USD`/`EUR`), theme (Dark/Light Mode), and set a custom electricity cost for more accurate profit calculations.
    *   **Profitability Calculator:** Build an interactive page where users can select a coin and enter a hashrate to see real-time profitability statistics.
    *   **Global Notifications:** Implement a toast notification system for rig status changes, API errors, and other critical alerts.
    *   **Advanced Charts:** Add more chart types to the dashboard, such as a multi-line chart for individual rig temperatures or a pie chart showing hashrate distribution by algorithm.

### What Can Be Done (Long-Term Vision & Contribution Ideas)

This outlines the long-term potential of the project. Contributions in these areas are highly welcome!

*   **Backend & Real-Time Data:**
    *   **WebSocket Integration:** Replace the mock API's `setInterval` with a real WebSocket connection to a backend service for true, push-based real-time data updates.
    *   **User Authentication:** Add user accounts and database integration (e.g., with Supabase or a custom Node.js backend) to save rig configurations, settings, and historical data.
    *   **Real Miner API Integration:** Develop modules to connect to the APIs of popular mining software and services (e.g., HiveOS, NiceHash, T-Rex Miner) to pull in real hardware data.

*   **Advanced Features:**
    *   **Historical Data Export:** Add functionality to export chart data and performance reports as CSV or PDF files.
    *   **Customizable Alerts:** Allow users to set up custom alerts (e.g., "notify me if a rig's temperature exceeds 80Â°C") that could eventually be sent via email or Discord webhooks.
    *   **PWA Support:** Convert the application into a full Progressive Web App for a native-like experience on mobile devices, including push notifications.
